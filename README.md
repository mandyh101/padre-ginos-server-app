# Padre Gino's Server Application

This repo contains the API for running the Padre Gino's Online Pizza story.
This is part of a project I built following along with the Frontend Masters Complete Intro to React course.

## Tech
- Node.js
- Fastify

## Deploy
- cd into the api folder `cd api`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

### Render
Render dashboard: *https://padre-ginos-server-app.onrender.com* (password protected)
Test the api: https://padre-ginos-server-app.onrender.com/api/pizzas (yes, it's slow! Free tier life baby!)
